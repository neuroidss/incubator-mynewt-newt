# RELEASE NOTES

30 Apr 2016 - Apache Newt v0.9.0

For full release notes, please visit the
[Apache Mynewt Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MYNEWT/Release+Notes).

Apache Newt is the build and package management system for the Apache Mynewt
project.  More information on Newt can be found
[here](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-mynewt-dev/201603.mbox/%3C56E21C13.9050303%40apache.org%3E)

As a beta release of Apache Newt, the normal caveat applies: APIs and commands
are subject to change.  However, Apache Mynewt continues to stabilize with each
release, and we believe this release is a further step forward.  People who are
interested in playing around, and trying Newt, are encouraged to download and
begin to evaluate it.

Future versions will add:

  * More robust package management and versioning

  * Plenty of helper commands for seeing what's installed, what's changed,
    and why things failed.

If working on next-generation build and source package management systems
sounds exciting to you, get in touch, by sending a mail to the Apache Mynewt
Developer's list, dev@mynewt.incubator.apache.org.
